# CS-255-Portfolio
System analysis and design work for the DriverPass project, including requirements and system design documents.

# DriverPass Portfolio Submission

This repository includes the business requirements document from Project One and the system design document from Project Two. These two documents show how I collected the client’s needs and designed a system that supports students, secretaries, IT officers, DMV staff, and admins.

## Project Summary

The DriverPass project focused on building a system that helps students prepare for their driving test. The client wanted scheduling, practice test features, progress tracking, and account tools. They also needed support for staff roles. The secretary manages student accounts and updates information. The IT officer unlocks or resets accounts. The DMV provides updated content. The admin prints activity reports. The system had to support all of these tasks without making the design complicated.

## What I Did Well

I translated the client’s needs into clear diagrams that match how the system works in real life. I kept each feature tied to a specific user so the system stays organized. I also made sure my diagrams stayed consistent with the use case layout. My activity diagrams and sequence diagram follow the exact workflows I designed, which shows that the system logic stays the same from start to finish.

## What I Would Revise

If I revised one part of my work, I would focus on the use case diagram. I spent a lot of time fixing placement and cleaning up the associations, but I think I could have created a cleaner layout from the start. I would reduce clutter, balance the spacing, and show the relationships in a way that is easier to read at a glance. A clearer structure would have helped me build the other diagrams faster.

## How I Interpreted User Needs

I broke down what each person needed to do. Students handle everything from booking lessons to resetting passwords. The secretary creates student accounts and manages updates. The IT officer needs simple controls to unlock accounts. The DMV needs a way to provide updated content. The admin reviews activity reports. I used these tasks to shape the design so each user sees only the tools that match their role. This keeps the system focused and avoids extra steps.

It is important to focus on user needs because the system has to support real tasks. If the features do not match how people actually work, the system becomes confusing or slows them down.

## My Approach to Software Design

I design software by breaking the problem into smaller parts. I start with gathering the requirements. Then I create diagrams that show the workflow, the system structure, and the interactions. For this project, the use case diagram helped me define what each person does. The activity diagrams let me walk through the steps. The sequence diagram showed the detailed interactions. The class diagram outlined the structure. This approach keeps the design clear and helps me catch issues early.

I plan to continue using this method because it keeps the system aligned with the client’s needs and gives a clear path from requirements to design.
